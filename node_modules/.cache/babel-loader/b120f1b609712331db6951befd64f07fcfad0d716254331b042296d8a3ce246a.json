spark\n                                    debate. With its unique principles and\n                                    individualized approach to healing,\n                                    homeopathy offers a holistic perspective on\n                                    health and well-being. In this article, we\n                                    explore the foundations of homeopathy and\n                                    examine its enduring appeal.\n                                  </p>\n                                  <p>\n                                    <strong>Principles of Homeopathy</strong>{\" \"}\n                                    (100 words):Homeopathy is based on two\n                                    fundamental principles: &quot;like cures\n                                    like&quot; and the &quot;law of minimum\n                                    dose.&quot; According to the principle of\n                                    similars, a substance that can cause\n                                    symptoms in a healthy person can be used to\n                                    treat similar symptoms in an individual who\n                                    is unwell. The law of minimum dose states\n                                    that the more diluted a substance is, the\n                                    more potent it becomes.
